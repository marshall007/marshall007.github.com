			<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I am a currently working full time as a software developer. I really enjoy studying and learning new things, something I believe is critical to the software development trade. If I'm not working on a personal project or browsing open-source repos, my free time is usually spent browsing Hacker News or reddit while listening to music. I also enjoy swimming and a good game of ultimate frisbee.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Langley &amp; Taylor Pool Corporation, Nashville TN</h3>

<p>Full-time seasonal employment as a pool lifeguard. Within two weeks of employment I advanced from a general guard to supervisor and assigned the opening and closing shifts. I was responsible for the general safety of patrons, and maintenance of the pool and pool area. I was offered and accepted extra hours and responsibilities including working shifts at other locations managed by Langley &amp; Taylor.</p>

<h3>Williamson County Parks and Recreation, Brentwood TN</h3>

<h4>Lifeguard &mdash; 2006 through 2010</h4>

<p>I was employed as a year round, part-time guard at the Indoor Sports Complex. Even as a general guard, I often either substituted for the supervisor and took on relevant responsibilities for the day, or was asked to supervise co-workers while a manager could not be present.</p>

<p>As a substitute guard at this neighborhood pool, I was responsible for the general saftey of patrons, cleaning and maintenance of the pool area, and working in the concessions stand taking and filling orders.</p>
